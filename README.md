COMMANDS

Commands run (ufw allow, ufw deny, ufw status).



A firewall acts like a security guard between your computer/network and the outside world.
It decides whether to allow or block network packets based on rules.

üîπ 1. Packet Inspection

Every piece of network communication is broken into packets.

A firewall examines these packets (header + data).

It checks:

Source IP (where it came from)

Destination IP (where it‚Äôs going)

Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)

Port number (e.g., 80 for web, 22 for SSH, 23 for Telnet)

üîπ 2. Rule Matching

Firewalls have a rule set (like an if-else list).

Rules can say things like:

Allow traffic to port 22 (SSH).

Deny traffic from IP 203.0.113.5.

Block all inbound Telnet (port 23).

The firewall compares each packet to its rules from top to bottom until it finds a match.

üîπ 3. Filtering Methods

Packet Filtering: Looks at packet headers only (fast but basic).

Stateful Inspection: Tracks connections and only allows packets that are part of a valid session (more secure).

Application Layer Filtering: Examines actual data (e.g., blocks malicious HTTP requests).

üîπ 4. Types of Filtering

Inbound filtering: Controls traffic coming into your device/network. Example: Block Telnet (23) from outside.

Outbound filtering: Controls traffic going out. Example: Stop malware from sending data to a hacker‚Äôs server.

üîπ 5. Example (UFW)
